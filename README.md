# Flysand's spring breeze

This theme is inspired by the sensation of the cool spring breeze. The kind of wind, that's gentle,
not freezing, but also not warm enough yet.

This theme is on the simplistic side. There's a small amount of colors, but I tried to make, as
much as possible, within the limitations of `tmGrammar` highlighting, the most important concepts
stand out in a similar fashion. All types are purple-ish, the functions, methods etc are blue.
Keywords are green.

Oh yeah, and also comments and keywords are greyed out. I don't think I can make it any better, but
the idea is to allow you to skim what is essentially "not code".

This theme somewhat supports semantic highlighting.

## Examples

Typescript (no semantic highlighting):

Rust (with semantic highlighting from `rust-analyzer`):
